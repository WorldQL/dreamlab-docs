# Why Dreamlab?

Dreamlab is laser-focused on one thing: fast and easy multiplayer.


Our engine is multiplayer-by-default and runs right in your web browser. You can share your games with a link and your friends can be playing your creation in seconds. No downloads required.

Dreamlab also features an AI-powered asset creator that allows you to create objects, characters, weapons, enemies, and more with just text! Instead of using stock art or basic shapes, you can give your game unique art right away.

## Compared to Roblox
Roblox is similar to Dreamlab's in three ways:
- Games are multiplayer by default. Games have client-only, server-only, and shared scripts.
- Physics is networked out of the box.
- Hosting for your game servers is free forever with unlimited players.

Dreamlab is unique in that:
- Scripting is done in JavaScript or TypeScript instead of Luau.
- Dreamlab currently only supports 2D games but we have plans to expand to the third dimension someday!

## Compared to Unity
Unity is a singleplayer engine by default. Third-party networking tools are required for state synchronization.

## Compared to GameMaker Studio
Both GameMaker Studio and Dreamlab are 2D game engines with built-in multiplayer support.
Dreamlab is different because:
- Dreamlab's netcode is based on snapshot interpolation, not inputs.
- Dreamlab uses dedicated servers with full authority instead of p2p (todo: make sure this is accurate)
- Dreamlab offers AI-powered asset generation!

## Compared to Minecraft / Spigot
Minecraft (particularly with Spigot Plugins) can be a great way to make custom multiplayer games. Like Minecraft, Dreamlab has base components you can modify like a character controller and hostile mobs. Additionally, players can build inside worlds and their placed objects can be saved.

Unlike Minecraft, Dreamlab allows you to create standalone games that anyone can access with a link.
