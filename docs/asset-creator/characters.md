# Characters

Dreamlab's character generator is used to create animated sprites.

It has the following components:
- Rigs. 3D models that get used to output depth maps and pose information. Currently, there are two rigs available, one feminine and one masculine.
- Animations. Animation files using the Mixamo bone convention that are used to drive rigs.
- AI Painter. Generates 2D sprites for each frame of an animation.
