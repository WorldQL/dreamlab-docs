# Concepts

## Projects

Dreamlab Projects are a collection of behavior scripts, assets, and the scene definition. A project usually represents
everything needed to create a complete game.

Projects can be imported into other projects, similar to how `.unitypackage` files work. This means you can also use
projects as re-usable collections of assets, prefabs, or behavior scripts.

## Entities

Entities are the building blocks of your scene, they are like Godot's Node or Unity's GameObject. Different entity types
will have different logic associated with them, such as displaying a texture (Sprite, AnimatedSprite, etc) or simulating
physics (Collider, RigidBody, etc).

## Behaviors

Behaviors are user scripts written in TypeScript that attach to Entities, these are similar to Godot Scripts or Unity
MonoBehaviors. By convention all behavior scripts live inside the `src` folder in a project.

## Assets

Assets are any static files your project may need to reference, eg: images, sound clips, data files, etc. By convention
assets live in the `assets` folder in a project.

### Resource URIs

You can reference assets using `res://` URIs. These are relative to the project root.

:::info

Behavior scripts can also be referenced using Resource URIs, though the Dreamlab Editor takes care of this automatically
so you won't usually need to do this.
