# Scripting

<UnderConstruction />

Dreamlab scripts are written in TypeScript and all new projects are created from one of our pre-made templates.
These templates are setup to work with Dreamlab correctly out of the box, so you don't need to worry about configuring anything yourself.

## Entrypoints

All scripts must implement three entrypoints for client code, server code, and level data. These are `client.ts`, `server.ts`, and `level.ts` respectively.
Note that level.ts is automatically generated by the level editor and cannot be edited by hand.
Client and Server entrypoints must export a single function named `init()` that has a single argument, a reference to the current Dreamlab game context.

Although not strictly required, we recommend defining another shared entrypoint that is called by both client and server `init()` functions that calls
any common code shared between client and server. A good example of such code would be [registering spawnable entities](./entities.mdx#registering).

<Callout>
  All new projects created from our templates already have these entrypoints set
  up correctly and are fully type-safe.

```ts filename="shared.ts"
import type { InitShared } from '@dreamlab.gg/core/sdk'

export const sharedInit: InitShared = async game => {
  // ...
}
```

```ts filename="client.ts"
import type { InitClient } from '@dreamlab.gg/core/sdk'
import { sharedInit } from './shared.ts'

export const init: InitClient = async game => {
  await sharedInit(game)

  // ...
}
```

```ts filename="server.ts"
import type { InitServer } from '@dreamlab.gg/core/sdk'
import { sharedInit } from './shared.ts'

export const init: InitServer = async game => {
  await sharedInit(game)

  // ...
}
```
