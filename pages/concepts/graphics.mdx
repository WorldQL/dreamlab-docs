# Graphics

<Callout>
  Dreamlab uses [Pixi.js](https://pixijs.com/) for its graphics rendering.
  Anything you can draw with Pixi you can draw in Dreamlab.
</Callout>

Draw still images, parallax backgrounds, and basic geometry with Dreamlab's graphics library.

To draw a box, you can insert the following into `initRenderContext` for an entity:

```ts filename="TypeScript"
initRenderContext (_, { camera, stage }) {
  const container = new Container();
  container.sortableChildren = true;
  container.zIndex = zIndex;
  const graphics = new Graphics();
  graphics.zIndex = zIndex;

  drawBox(graphics, { width, height }, { stroke: "#00f" });
  container.addChild(graphics);

  stage.addChild(container);
  return {
    camera,
    container,
    graphics,
    sprite,
  };
}
```

`drawBox` is a utility function that is passed a pixi.js Graphics object. You can see all the graphics utility functions [here](https://github.com/WorldQL/dreamlab-core/blob/trunk/src/utils/draw.ts).
