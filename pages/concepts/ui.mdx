# User Interfaces

<UnderConstruction />

Dreamlab allows you to create a UI layer on top of the game window using web technologies. You can use familiar DOM manipulation
to create and update your UI.

## Creating a UI Layer

{/* TODO: Flavour text */}

```ts filename="TypeScript"
import type { InitClient } from '@dreamlab.gg/core/sdk'

export const init: InitClient = async game => {
  // ... initialize client

  // Create a Shadow DOM root
  const root = game.client.ui.create()

  // Create a div and append it to the Shadow DOM
  const container = document.createElement('div')
  container.style.width = '100%'
  container.style.height = '100%'
  root.append(container)

  // ... setup your UI and event listeners
}
```

## Drealab UI

Dreamlab UI is a separate package dedicated to making common UI patterns easier. **Currently only React is supported.**
The package is published on npm as [`@dreamlab.gg/ui`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dreamlab.gg/ui)
and is available by default in the Dreamlab scripting runtime.

Dreamlab UI React exposes many hooks that allow you to get references to game state in a react-safe way, such that they trigger
re-renders when their state changes. This requires some setup internally, so it also provides a `renderUI` function that takes
care of all the UI setup and state tracking for you.

### React Hooks

  For a full list of hooks, consult the
  [source](https://github.com/WorldQL/dreamlab-ui/tree/trunk/src/react/hooks).

| Hook Signature                                       | Description                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useGame(): Game`                                    | Returns a reference to the current `Game`                             |
| `usePlayer(): Player`                                | Returns a reference to the player                                     |
| `useCamera(): Camera`                                | Returns a reference to the camera                                     |
| `useEntities(): readonly Entity[]`                   | Returns a list of all current entities (including spawnable entities) |
| `useSpawnableEntities(): readonly SpawnableEntity[]` | Returns a list of **only** spawnable entities                         |

## Examples

### React

```tsx filename="TSX"
import type { InitClient } from '@dreamlab.gg/core/sdk'
import { renderUI } from '@dreamlab.gg/ui/react'

const Root = () => {
  return <div>Hello React!</div>
}

export const init: InitClient = async game => {
  // ... initialize client

  // Render React using Dreamlab UI
  renderUI(game, <Root />)
}
```

### React with Styled Components

Using CSS-in-JS libraries can drastically reduce complexity introduced by styling your UI.

{/* TODO: React + Styled Components example */}

## Native UI

It is also possible to create UI using Pixi.js natively, although this is not recommended due to the complexity with
drawing using Pixi.js and managing inputs.
