# Characters

Dreamlab's character generator is used to create animated sprites.

It has the following components:

- Rigs. 3D models that get used to output depth maps and pose information. Currently, there are two rigs available, one feminine and one masculine.
- Animations. Animation files using the Mixamo bone convention that are used to drive rigs.
- AI Painter. Generates 2D sprites for each frame of an animation.

## How To Use

To generate an animated character, simply enter your prompt, select your skeleton, and press "Generate Preview"! Once you're happy with your creation, you can click "Generate Full Animation" to generate a complete set of spritesheets for all animations.
