# Characters

<Callout type='info'>This page is under construction.</Callout>

Dreamlab's character generator is used to create animated sprites.

It has the following components:

- Rigs. 3D models that get used to output depth maps and pose information. Currently, there are two rigs available, one feminine and one masculine.
- Animations. Animation files using the Mixamo bone convention that are used to drive rigs.
- AI Painter. Generates 2D sprites for each frame of an animation.

## Prompting

{
// This doesn't work so I'm removing it

// ### Concept Isolation

// Dreamlab allows you to associate certain words with certain objects explicitly.

// For example, this prompt may lead to colors bleeding across concepts (black applies to pants, green applies to background or shoes, etc.):

// `// man wearing a black jacket, blue pants, green baseball cap
//`

// We can see that in this result:
// video here

// However, we can rewrite our prompt like this:

// `// man wearing a [black: jacket], [blue: pants], [green: baseball cap]
//`

// video here

// Here's another example:

// `// knight wearing armor, red helmet, black chestplate full body
//`

// ...

// This solves the problem of having color bleed into the rest of your image.
