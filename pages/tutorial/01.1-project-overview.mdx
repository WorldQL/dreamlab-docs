# Project Overview

The sample project only has a few entities:

1. BulletHeavenPlayer. This entity is the hooded figure that each player controls an instance of.
2. Enemy. This is an enemy that runs at the player.
3. Xp. This entity is dropped by enemies when they die.

It has a UI layer written using React displaying the player's health and current XP.
**Because it was made using Dreamlab, it has seamless multiplayer support. Players can fight together against an endless stream of monsters!**
